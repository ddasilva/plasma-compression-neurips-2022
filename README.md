# From Particles to Fluids: Dimensionality Reduction for Non-Maxwellian Plasma Velocity Distributions Validated in the Fluid Context

This code accompanies two papers: a [short conference proceedings paper](https://ml4physicalsciences.github.io/2022/files/NeurIPS_ML4PS_2022_73.pdf) to the NeurIPS 2022 conference, and a full-length version of that paper published early the following year in Frontiers in Astronomy and Space Sciences. The title of the NeurIPS paper is above, and the full-length paper is titled  [The Impact of Dimensionality Reduction of Ion Counts Distributions on Preserving Moments with Applications to Data Compression](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fspas.2022.1056508/full).

This code trains a learned, patch-based, dimensionality reductive method for  plasma ion counts distributions using data from the MMS satellite mission's FPI/DIS instrument. It requires data from MMS FPI/DIS, available for free online at the [MMS Science Data Center](https://lasp.colorado.edu/mms/sdc/public/).
